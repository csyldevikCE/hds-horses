# HDS Horses - Multi-Tenant Horse Management System

## Project Overview

HDS Horses is a multi-tenant web application for managing horse listings, competitions, media, and team collaboration. Organizations can have up to 2 administrators and 2 read-only users, with role-based access control throughout the application.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React 19, TypeScript, Vite
- **UI Components**: Radix UI, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth + Storage)
- **State Management**: React Context API, TanStack Query
- **Routing**: React Router v6
- **Security**: bcryptjs for password hashing
- **Deployment**: Vercel

## Database Schema

### Core Tables

#### `profiles`
Stores user profile information (first name, last name).
- `id` (UUID, FK to auth.users)
- `first_name` (TEXT)
- `last_name` (TEXT)
- `created_at`, `updated_at`

**RLS Policies**:
- Users can view profiles of users in their organization
- Users can update/insert their own profile
- Auto-created via trigger on user signup

#### `organizations`
Multi-tenant organizations that own horses and manage team members.
- `id` (UUID, PK)
- `name` (TEXT)
- `created_by` (UUID, FK to auth.users)
- `created_at`, `updated_at`

**RLS Policies**:
- Users can view their own organization
- Users can update their organization if admin

#### `organization_users`
Junction table for organization membership and roles.
- `id` (UUID, PK)
- `organization_id` (UUID, FK to organizations)
- `user_id` (UUID, FK to auth.users)
- `role` ('admin' | 'read_only')
- `invited_by`, `invited_at`, `joined_at`

**Business Rules**:
- Maximum 2 admins per organization
- Maximum 2 read-only users per organization
- First user to sign up automatically becomes admin of new organization

**RLS Policies**:
- Users can view members of their organization
- Admins can insert/update/delete members

#### `horses`
Main horse records with detailed information.
- Basic info: `name`, `breed`, `age`, `color`, `gender`, `height`, `weight`
- Status: `status` ('Available' | 'Sold' | 'Reserved' | 'Not for Sale')
- Pedigree: 4-generation pedigree tree (sire/dam lineage)
- Health: `health_vaccinations`, `health_coggins`, `health_last_vet_check`
- Training: `training_level`, `training_disciplines` (array)
- Ownership: `user_id`, `organization_id`

**RLS Policies**:
- Users can view horses in their organization
- Admins can insert/update/delete horses
- Read-only users can only view

#### `horse_images`
Horse photo gallery with primary image support.
- `horse_id`, `url`, `caption`, `is_primary`

#### `horse_videos`
YouTube video links for horses.
- `horse_id`, `url`, `caption`, `thumbnail`

#### `competitions`
Competition results and achievements.
- `horse_id`, `event`, `date`, `discipline`, `placement`
- `notes`, `equipe_link` (external link to results)

#### `share_links`
Shareable public links for horse profiles with advanced features.
- `id`, `token` (unique identifier for URL)
- `horse_id`, `organization_id`, `created_by`
- `recipient_name`, `expires_at`, `created_at`
- `link_type` ('standard' | 'one_time' | 'password_protected')
- `password_hash` (bcrypt hash for password-protected links)
- `view_count`, `max_views` (for one-time links)
- `shared_fields` (JSONB array of fields to share)

**Link Types**:
- **Standard**: Time-based expiration, unlimited views until expiry
- **One-Time**: Limited number of views (typically 1), then becomes invalid
- **Password Protected**: Requires password to access, most secure option

**Shareable Fields** (customizable per link):
- `basic_info` - Name, breed, age, color, gender, height
- `description` - Full text description
- `pedigree` - 4-generation pedigree tree
- `health` - Vaccinations, coggins, vet check dates
- `training` - Training level and disciplines
- `competitions` - Event history and placements
- `images` - Photo gallery
- `videos` - YouTube videos
- `price` - Asking price

**RLS Policies**:
- Organization members can view their share links
- Public (anonymous) can view any share link by token
- Only admins can create/update/delete share links

#### `share_link_views`
Detailed analytics for share link tracking.
- `id`, `share_link_id` (FK to share_links)
- `viewed_at` (timestamp)
- `ip_address`, `user_agent`, `referer`
- `country`, `city`, `region` (for future IP geolocation)

**Purpose**: Track individual views with device info, location, and source.

**RLS Policies**:
- Organization members can view analytics for their share links
- Anyone (including anonymous) can insert view records

## Authentication & Authorization

### Authentication Flow

1. **Signup** (`/signup`):
   - User creates account with email/password
   - Profile record auto-created via database trigger
   - New organization created automatically
   - User added to organization_users as admin

2. **Login** (`/login`):
   - Email/password authentication via Supabase Auth
   - Session persisted in localStorage
   - Auto-refresh token enabled

3. **Session Persistence**:
   - AuthContext initializes immediately with session
   - Organization data loaded in background (non-blocking)
   - Loading state set to false after session check to prevent redirect

### Authorization Model

**Role-based Access Control**:
- `admin`: Full CRUD access to horses, can manage team members
- `read_only`: View-only access to horses, cannot edit/delete

**Helper Functions** (`src/types/organization.ts`):
```typescript
isAdmin(role): boolean
isReadOnly(role): boolean
```

### Auth Context Structure

```typescript
{
  user: User | null,
  session: Session | null,
  organization: Organization | null,
  userRole: 'admin' | 'read_only' | null,
  loading: boolean,
  signUp(email, password, firstName, lastName),
  signIn(email, password),
  signOut(),
  refreshOrganization()
}
```

- `src/services/shareService.ts` - Share link CRUD, password hashing/verification, analytics, view tracking

### Database
- `database/migrations/` - SQL migration scripts
  - `015_create_profiles_table.sql` - Profiles table with auto-creation trigger

## Common Patterns

### 1. Loading User Profile with Names

```typescript
const [profile, setProfile] = useState<{ first_name: string | null; last_name: string | null } | null>(null)

const loadProfile = async () => {
  const { data } = await supabase
    .from('profiles')
    .select('first_name, last_name')
    .eq('id', user.id)
    .single()

  if (data) setProfile(data)
}
```

### 2. Organization-Scoped Queries

```typescript
// Get horses for user's organization
const { data: horses } = await supabase
  .from('horses')
  .select('*')
  .eq('organization_id', organization.id)
```

RLS policies automatically enforce organization boundaries, but queries should still include organization_id for clarity.

### 3. Role-Based UI

```typescript
import { isAdmin } from '@/types/organization'

// Hide edit buttons for read-only users
{isAdmin(userRole) && (
  <Button onClick={handleEdit}>Edit</Button>
)}
```

### 4. Fetching Related Data with JOINs

Use Supabase's JOIN syntax to fetch related data in a single query:

```typescript
// Single query with JOIN via FK relationship
const { data } = await supabase
  .from('organization_users')
  .select(`
    *,
    profiles (
      first_name,
      last_name
    )
  `)
  .eq('organization_id', orgId)

// Data is already joined - no JavaScript merging needed!
const members = data.map(member => ({
  ...member,
  displayName: `${member.profiles.first_name} ${member.profiles.last_name}`
}))
```

**Key**: This works because we have a direct FK relationship: `organization_users.user_id → profiles.id` (added in migration 016).

### 5. Profile Update Pattern

```typescript
// Update profiles table (single source of truth)
await supabase
  .from('profiles')
  .upsert({ id: user.id, first_name, last_name })

// Notify other components
window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('profile-updated'))
```

Profile data is stored ONLY in the `profiles` table. Auth metadata is not used.

### 6. Share Link Creation

```typescript
import { shareService, ShareLinkType, ShareableField } from '@/services/shareService'

// Create a share link
const shareLink = await shareService.createShareLink({
  horseId: horse.id,
  organizationId: organization.id,
  userId: user.id,
  recipientName: 'Client Name',
  linkType: 'password_protected', // or 'standard', 'one_time'
  expiresAt: new Date(Date.now() + 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000).toISOString(), // 24 hours
  password: 'secretpass', // only for password_protected
  maxViews: 1, // only for one_time
  sharedFields: ['basic_info', 'pedigree', 'images', 'videos']
})

// Update an existing share link
await shareService.updateShareLink({
  shareLinkId: link.id,
  recipientName: 'Updated Name',
  expiresAt: newExpiryDate.toISOString(),
  sharedFields: ['basic_info', 'pedigree', 'images', 'videos', 'price']
})

// Get analytics
const analytics = await shareService.getShareLinkAnalytics(shareLinkId)
// Returns: { totalViews, uniqueVisitors, lastViewed, recentViews, viewsByDate, viewsByCountry, views, ipFirstSeen }
```

**Password Hashing**: Uses bcryptjs with 10 salt rounds. Passwords are hashed before storage, never stored in plain text.

### 7. Public Share Link Access

Share links use the anonymous (`anon`) role in Supabase. Key requirements:

```sql
-- Required: Grant SELECT permission to anon role
GRANT SELECT ON public.share_links TO anon;
GRANT SELECT ON public.horses TO anon;
GRANT SELECT ON public.horse_images TO anon;
GRANT SELECT ON public.horse_videos TO anon;
GRANT SELECT ON public.competitions TO anon;

-- Required: RLS policies that allow public access
CREATE POLICY "Public can view share links"
ON public.share_links FOR SELECT
USING (true);

CREATE POLICY "Public can view horses with share links"
ON public.horses FOR SELECT
USING (
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM public.share_links
    WHERE share_links.horse_id = horses.id
  )
);
```

**Testing Anonymous Access**:
```sql
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor to test if anon role can access data
SET LOCAL ROLE anon;
SELECT * FROM public.share_links WHERE token = 'your_token_here';
RESET ROLE;
```

If this query returns nothing, RLS policies or GRANT permissions need to be fixed.

## Known Issues & Gotchas

### 1. Session Persistence
- **Issue**: Setting loading state before organization fetch caused premature redirects
- **Solution**: Set `loading = false` immediately after session check, fetch org in background
- **Location**: `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx:125-192`

### 2. Dialog Auto-Focus
- **Issue**: Black borders appear on inputs when dialog opens
- **Solution**: Add `onOpenAutoFocus={(e) => e.preventDefault()}` to DialogContent
- **Location**: All dialog components

### 3. React Query Configuration
- **Previous Issue**: Refetching was disabled due to perceived "excessive refetching"
- **Root Cause**: Mismatched query keys between queries and invalidations (e.g., `organization.id` vs `user.id`)
- **Solution**: Fixed all query key mismatches, re-enabled refetching with proper staleTime
- **Location**: `src/App.tsx:18-30`
- **Key Pattern**: Always use `organization.id` in horses query keys, not `user.id`

### 4. Share Link Public Access (CURRENT ISSUE - IN PROGRESS)
- **Status**: Debugging in progress as of 2025-10-21
- **Symptoms**: Share links show "Link Not Available" error when accessed
- **Database Status**: ✅ Working correctly
  - Share link exists in database
  - `anon` role has SELECT permissions on all required tables
  - RLS policies allow public access
  - Direct SQL query as `anon` role returns share link data successfully
- **Frontend Status**: ⚠️ Partially working
  - First query (getSharedHorseMetadata) succeeds - share link metadata loads
  - Second query (getSharedHorse) status unknown - needs console output
- **Next Steps**:
  1. Check browser console for "Fetching horse data" and error messages
  2. Verify horseService.getHorse() has proper RLS access for anonymous users
  3. Check if horse data query is even being triggered (conditional rendering issue)
  4. Test share link in incognito window with dev tools open
- **Debugging Tools Added**:
  - Console logging in SharedHorse.tsx lines 27-29, 40-48
  - Error logging in shareService.ts line 206-207
- **Related Files**:
  - `src/pages/SharedHorse.tsx` - Public share link page
  - `src/services/shareService.ts` - Share link service layer
  - `database/migrations/022_grant_anon_access_to_shares.sql` - Anonymous access grants

## Environment Variables

Required in `.env`:
```

3. Test organization creation, user invitations, and role permissions
4. Implement actual email invitations (currently placeholder)
5. Add email verification flow
6. Add password reset functionality
7. Add organization switching (if users can belong to multiple orgs)
8. Add audit logging for admin actions

### Potential Enhancements
- Real-time collaboration with Supabase Realtime
- File upload for horse images (currently URLs only)
- Advanced search and filtering
- Export horse data to PDF
- Mobile app version
- Calendar integration for competitions
- Veterinary records management
- Training logs and progress tracking

## Architecture Decisions

### Why Multi-Tenant?
- Each organization owns their horses completely
- Data isolation enforced at database level via RLS
- Shared infrastructure reduces costs
- Easy to scale

### Why Context API over Redux?
- Simpler for auth state
- Less boilerplate
- Sufficient for current scope
- TanStack Query handles server state

### Why Supabase?
- Built-in auth with RLS integration
- PostgreSQL with full SQL support
- Real-time capabilities for future features
- Generous free tier
- Fast development

### Why Use Direct FK Relationships for JOINs?
- Direct foreign key relationship: `organization_users.user_id → profiles.id` (migration 016)
- Enables Supabase PostgREST to traverse relationships automatically
- Single query instead of multiple + JavaScript merge
- Better performance and cleaner code

## Testing Notes

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Sign up creates organization and admin user
- [ ] Login persists across page refresh
- [ ] Profile updates show in avatar initials
- [ ] Admin can see all team members
- [ ] Read-only users cannot see edit buttons
- [ ] Share links work without authentication
- [ ] Horse CRUD operations work for admins
- [ ] RLS prevents cross-organization data access

### Key Test Scenarios
1. **Multi-user**: Create 2 admin + 2 read-only accounts in same org
2. **Permissions**: Verify read-only users cannot edit/delete
3. **Organization isolation**: Create second org, verify no data leakage
4. **Session persistence**: Refresh page, verify no logout
5. **Profile sync**: Update name, verify avatar and member list update
