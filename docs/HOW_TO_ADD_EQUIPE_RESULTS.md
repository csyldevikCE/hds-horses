# How to Add Competition Results with Equipe Links

## Quick Guide for Admins

This guide shows you how to add competition results to a horse's profile and link them to Equipe (or other competition platforms).

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Navigate to Horse Detail Page
- Go to your horse inventory
- Click "View Details" on any horse card
- You'll see the horse's full profile page

### 2. Open the Results Tab
- Click on the **"Results"** tab in the navigation bar
- This tab is always visible, even if no results exist yet
- You'll see either existing results or an empty state

### 3. Click "Add Result" Button
- Look for the blue "Add Result" button in the top-right of the Results card
- **Note**: Only admins can see this button (read-only users cannot add results)
- Click it to open the competition form dialog

### 4. Fill Out Competition Details

#### Required Information
Fill out these fields (marked with *):

**Event Name***
- Enter the full name of the competition
- Example: `Kentucky Horse Park Spring Classic`
- Example: `Wellington Winter Series Week 4`

**Date***
- Use the date picker to select the competition date
- Defaults to today's date
- Click the calendar icon to change

**Discipline***
- Type of competition
- Examples:
  - `Show Jumping`
  - `Dressage`
  - `Eventing`
  - `Hunter/Jumper`
  - `Cross Country`

**Placement***
- The horse's result/placement
- Examples:
  - `1st Place` (will get special gold badge!)
  - `2nd Place`
  - `3rd Place`
  - `Clear Round`
  - `Qualified`
  - `4th Place`

### 5. Add Competition Platform Link (Optional)

This is where you can link to external results platforms like Equipe.

#### Finding Your Equipe Link

1. **Go to Equipe website**: Navigate to https://online.equipe.com
2. **Find your competition**: Search for the event
3. **Copy the URL**: The link will look like:
   ```
   https://online.equipe.com/startlists/1171508
   ```
4. **Paste in form**: Copy and paste the full URL into the "Results Link" field

#### Other Supported Platforms

You can also link to:
- **USEF**: `https://www.usef.org/...`
- **FEI**: `https://data.fei.org/...`
- **Any other competition website** with public results

#### Example URLs
```
✅ Good: https://online.equipe.com/startlists/1171508
✅ Good: https://www.usef.org/compete/results/2024/show-12345
✅ Good: https://data.fei.org/result/12345

❌ Bad: equipe.com (missing https://)
❌ Bad: Just the event name without URL
```

### 6. Add Notes (Optional)

Use the **Notes** field to add additional context:
- Weather conditions
- Course details
- Special achievements
- Horse's performance notes
- Any other relevant information

**Examples:**
```
"First time competing at this level - very proud!"
"Clear round in challenging weather conditions"
"Personal best time of 72.5 seconds"
"Course designed by John Smith, 1.30m height"
```

### 7. Submit the Form

- Click the blue **"Add Competition"** button at the bottom
- If there are any missing required fields, you'll see an error message
- If successful, you'll see a success notification
- The dialog will close automatically
- Your new result will appear immediately in the Results tab!

## What Happens After Submission?

### Immediate Display
- The competition appears in the Results list
- If it's a 1st place finish, it gets a special gold badge
- Notes appear in a highlighted box
- The Equipe/results link shows with a trophy icon and "View Full Results →" text

### Clickable Links
- Anyone viewing the horse (including shared link recipients) can click the results link
- Links open in a new tab
- Takes them directly to the full competition results on Equipe or the platform you linked

### In Share Links
- If you include "Competition Results" when creating a share link
- Recipients will see all the results you've added
- They can click through to Equipe to see full details

## Tips & Best Practices

### For Best Results
1. ✅ **Be specific with event names** - Use the full official name
2. ✅ **Include the exact date** - Helps track performance over time
3. ✅ **Use consistent discipline names** - Makes filtering easier later
4. ✅ **Always add Equipe links** - Provides verification and additional details
5. ✅ **Write detailed notes** - Future you will thank you for the context!

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
1. ❌ Don't abbreviate event names too much
2. ❌ Don't skip the Equipe link if available
3. ❌ Don't use vague placement terms (be specific: "1st Place" not "won")
4. ❌ Don't forget to save the form after filling it out

## Viewing Results

### Result Cards Show
- **Event Name** (large heading)
- **Discipline** (subheading)
- **Placement Badge** (right side, gold for 1st place)
- **Date** (below badge)
- **Notes** (if added, in highlighted box)
- **External Link** (trophy icon + "View Full Results →")

### Sorting
- Results appear in the order they were added
- Most recent additions show at the top
- (Future feature: Sort by date, placement, or discipline)

## Troubleshooting

### "Missing required fields" Error
- Check that you filled out: Event Name, Date, Discipline, and Placement
- All four are required to save a result

### "Error adding competition" Message
- Check your internet connection
- Verify you're logged in as an admin
- Try refreshing the page and submitting again
- If it persists, contact support

### Can't See "Add Result" Button
- This button is only visible to **admin** users
- Read-only users can view results but cannot add them
- Check your role in the organization settings

### Equipe Link Not Working
- Verify the URL is complete and starts with `https://`
- Make sure you copied the entire URL
- Test the link by opening it in a new tab first
- The URL validation will catch most formatting errors

## Example: Complete Entry

Here's what a complete, well-formatted entry looks like:

```
Event Name: Wellington Classic Week 6 - Grand Prix
Date: March 15, 2024
Discipline: Show Jumping
Placement: 2nd Place
Results Link: https://online.equipe.com/startlists/1171508
Notes: Clear round in first round, one rail down in jump-off.
       Time of 38.2 seconds. Course height 1.40m.
```

This will display as a beautiful card with:
- Large title "Wellington Classic Week 6 - Grand Prix"
- "Show Jumping" as subtitle
- Silver "2nd Place" badge
- "March 15, 2024" date
- Notes in highlighted box
- Blue link: "🏆 View Full Results →"
